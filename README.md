# FSGE: Justin Wasilenko - Unity

This plugin adds the style guide from  [Justin Wasilenko for Unity](https://github.com/justinwasilenko/Unity-Style-Guide) 
to the [FolderStyleGuideEnforcer (FSGE)](https://github.com/Neintonine/folder-style-guide-enforcer).

This does not add the entirety of the style guide, due to some technical issues, f.E. the texture packing. 
If you find a rule, that is missing or broken, either let me know or make a PR.
